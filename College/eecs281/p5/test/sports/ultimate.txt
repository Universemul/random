Ultimate (often called Ultimate Frisbee in reference to the trademarked brand name) is a non-contact competitive team game played with a 175 gram flying disc. The object of the game is to score points by passing the disc to a player in the opposing end-zone, similar to an end-zone in American football or rugby. Players may not run while holding the disc. Ultimate is distinguished by its spirit of the gameâ€”the principles of fair play, sportsmanship, and the joy of play.
While originally called "Ultimate Frisbee", "Frisbee" is the trademark for the line of discs made by the Wham-O toy company. In fact, discs made by Wham-O competitor Discraft are the standard discs for the game. Today, the game is simply known as "Ultimate".
