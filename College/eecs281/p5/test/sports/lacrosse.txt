Lacrosse is a sport played using a stick with a net on the end, called a crosse, which consists of usually a separate metal or wooden shaft, connected to the "head" of the crosse. The object of the game is to toss a rubber ball into the goal. Lacrosse can be played outdoors or indoors. Outdoors it is played on a field of grass or artificial turf. Indoors it can be played on turf. Indoor or box lacrosse is played on covered or melted ice hockey rinks.
