<P><BR>
</B>These apply to more than one IDE. Be sure to check the main course web pages under your specific IDE.<BR>

<B>My program runs but the output window disappears instantly when the program terminates.  How can I make it wait for me?<BR>
</B><BR>
This is a stupid &quot;feature&quot; of some of the Wintel IDEs.  Fortunately, it is easy to fix.   Simply have your program ask for some input before the final return from your main function. For example:<BR>
<BR>
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter any character to terminate.&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; <BR>
<BR>
char junk; <BR>
<BR>
cin &gt;&gt; junk;<BR>
<BR>
return 0;  // return from main function<BR>
