<H3>How to set up a Standard C project</H3>

<pre>
First, create a "Win32 Console application" and specify an empty project. 
Then create and add at least one source file to the project. 
Then apply the following changes to change it from C++ to C:

1. In the 'Solution Explorer', right-click on the project and select 'Properties'

2. In 'Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor'
   Append ';_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS' to the list of 'Preprocessor Definitions'

3. In 'Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation'
   Set 'Enable C++ Exceptions' to 'No'
   Set 'Floating Point Model' to 'Strict'

4. In 'Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Language'
   Set 'Disable Language Extensions' to 'Yes'
   Set 'Treat wchat_t as Built-in Type' to 'No'

5. In 'Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Advanced'
   Set 'Compile As' to 'Compile as C Code'

This will get you relatively close to the C89 standard, but it may still allow 
some things that the gcc with our recommended settings would not. 
We recommend testing with a build and check with gcc before submitting. 
See the "submit example" under Other Information on the Project 1 web page.

<pre>
First, create a "Win32 Console application" and specify an empty project. 
Then create and add at least one source file to the project. 
Then apply the following changes to change make it slightly more standard:

1. In the 'Solution Explorer', right-click on the project and select 'Properties'

2. In 'Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation'
   Set 'Floating Point Model' to 'Strict'

3. In 'Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Language'
   Set 'Disable Language Extensions' to 'Yes'
   Set 'Treat wchat_t as Built-in Type' to 'No'
   Set 'Force Conformance In For Loop Scope' to 'Yes'

This will prevent some non-standard compiler behavior, but it may still allow 
some things that the gcc with our recommended settings would not. 
We recommend testing with a build and check with gcc before submitting.
