If you get a page that says "not yet available," it should become available in the future. Ask about it only if we announced that it was supposed to be available.<p><b>Note:</b>Files listed as "pdf" can be viewed or downloaded and printedat high-quality with Adobe's Acrobat Reader. <p>Files listed as text are plain ASCII text files. The should display in yourbrowser with correct formatting, but can also be downloaded from the coursefile server; downloading with an ftp utility set to ASCII text mode is recommended for code and sample files to avoid line-ending problems.<hr><p><H2>Documents</H2><ul><li> <a href="project3/doc.pdf">Project Document (pdf)</a><li> <a href="corrections.html">Project Corrections & Clarifications</a><li> <a href="FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a></ul><H2> Component Specification Files</H2><p><ul><li> <a href="project3/starters/skeleton_Utilities.h"> Skeleton header file for Utilities.h with specification details.

You can avoid typing errors by downloading this file and then copy-pasting these into your program.<li> No makefile is provided, but you can modify the makefile from Project 2 for this project. Be sure to delete the no-elide-constructor option.</ul><H2>Behavior Samples</H2><p>Since Project 3 has the mostly the same functionality as Project 2, its behavior is very similar. These samples should be identical to those of Project 1 except for the numbered lines, the cross-reference command, the document statistics, and the lack of memory allocation output.<p><H3>Small Sample Behavior</H3><p> The following small sample illustrates the "normal" behavior of the program using a small input and contains the corresponding messages. Your program should reproduce the stdout and the output files exactly.<ul><li> <a href="project3/samples/small_console.txt">small_console.txt</a> Console interaction <BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/small_crd.txt">small_crd.txt</a> Dictionary creation document <BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/small_dct.txt">small_dct.txt</a> Dictionary file<BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/small_inp.txt">small_inp.txt</a> Input document for spell-checking<BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/small_stdin.txt">small_stdin.txt</a> stdin input file<BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/small_stdout.txt">small_stdout.txt</a> stdout output file<BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/small_out.txt">small_out.txt</a> Output document file<BR> <li> <a href="project3/samples/small_dct1.txt">small_dct1.txt</a> First output dictionary file<BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/small_dct2.txt">small_dct2.txt</a> Second output dictionary file. <BR> </ul><H3>Type-ahead & Errors Sample Behavior</H3><p> The following sample provides an extreme example of the user putting in excess whitespace and "typing ahead" and also shows the error messages produced by the program and how the rest of the input line is ignored after an error message. This sample uses the small_dct.txt and small_crd.txt sample files for input.Your program should reproduce the stdout and the output files exactly.<p>Your program should get the whitespace-skipping and type-ahead capability by simple and idiomatic use of the stream input facilities; you should get it "automatically" - no special coding involved. <p> It is difficult to produce an error on opening a file for output. This sample uses ".." as an illegal output filename. Send for help if you have trouble with producing an output file opening error on your platform.<ul><li> <a href="project3/samples/ta_errors_console.txt">ta_errors_console.txt </a> Console interaction <BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/ta_errors_inp.txt">ta_errors_inp.txt </a> Input  document for spell-checking <BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/ta_errors_stdin.txt">ta_errors_stdin.txt </a> stdin input file <BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/ta_errors_stdout.txt">ta_errors_stdout.txt </a> stdout output file <BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/ta_errors_out.txt">ta_errors_out.txt </a> Output document file  <BR> <li> <a href="project3/samples/ta_errors_dct.txt">ta_errors_dct.txt </a> Output dictionary file  <BR></ul><H3>Big Sample Behavior</H3><p> The following sample illustrates the behavior of the program in processing a large document (15K words). Your program should reproduce the stdout and the output files exactly.<ul><li> <a href="project3/samples/big_console.txt">big_console.txt </a> Console interaction  <BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/big_stdin.txt">big_stdin.txt </a> stdin input file  <BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/big_stdout.txt">big_stdout.txt </a> stdout output file <BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/big_crd.txt">big_crd.txt </a> Dictionary creation document  <BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/big_inp.txt">big_inp.txt </a> Input document for spell-checking  <BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/big_dct.txt">big_dct.txt </a> Output dictionary file  <BR><li> <a href="project3/samples/big_out.txt">big_out.txt </a> Output document file  <BR></ul><p>These samples demonstrate the program behavior and are supposed to contain every possible type of output message string.They are <b>not</b> a complete test of your program. Your program will be tested for a large number of other possible inputs and input sequences.<H2>Other Information</H2><p> See the course web page for how to compare files and redirect I/O. In the examples directory on the file server you can find the redirect_io module that you can use to redirect I/O from a C program on any platform. You can use this to help test your program's output against the supplied samples. The instructions are in the header file.<!--<H2>Excerpts from the Instructor's Solution</H2><p>The following shows a few critical functions from the Instructor's Solution. Of course, there are many other equally good ways of writing this code. Compare these to your code both for generalcode quality issues and to help clear up any issues about whether you code follow the specifications. Questions and comments are welcome. <p><b>Note:</b>You may use this code in your own projects in the current semester's offering of this course. <p><p><a href="project2/solution/">Instructor's solution excerpts</a>--></body></html>
