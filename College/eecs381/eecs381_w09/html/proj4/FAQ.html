<p class="p3"><b>I'm passing all of the output correctness test cases, but in the component tests, I'm passing some of the mixtures of "our" and "your" code, and failing others. Any suggestions?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Of course many things might be wrong, but a key possibility should be investigated: One of your modules isn't outputting the messages it is supposed to, so the mixture of your and our code results in messages that are missing or aren't supposed to be there. Check strings.txt and the specs carefully about where messages are supposed to appear.</p>

<p class="p3"><b>I'm passing all of the output correctness test cases, but in the component tests, I'm passing the "our Model-View-Controller, your code", but failing the "your Model-View-Controller our code" tests. Any suggestions?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Of course many things might be wrong, including the possibility in the previous FAQ. But an additional possibility is that your View isn't restoring the cout stream formatting state correctly, and is depending on code elsewhere to fix it. Check the stream formatting handout.</p>
