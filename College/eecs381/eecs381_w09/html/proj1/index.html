The project documents will be added to this page as they become available. If you get a page that says "not yet available," it should become available in the future. Ask about it only if we announced that it was supposed to be available.
<p>
<b>Note:</b>Files listed as "pdf" can be viewed or downloaded and printed
at high-quality with Adobe's Acrobat Reader. 
<p>
Files listed as text are plain ASCII text files. The should display in your
browser with correct formatting, but can also be downloaded from the course
file server; downloading with an ftp utility set to ASCII text mode is recommended for code and sample 
files to avoid line-ending problems.

<H2>Documents</H2>
<ul>
<li> <a href="project1/doc.pdf">Project Document (pdf)</a>
<li> <a href="corrections.html">Project Corrections & Clarifications</a>
<li> <a href="FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a>
<li> <a href="samplequalitychecklist.pdf">Sample Code Quality Checklist (pdf)</a><br>
When your code is evaluated for quality, it will be done using a checklist 
similar to this one. Try to make your code have these general properties and the specific properties discussed in lecture and the project specifications. Be sure to check your code against the specifications not just for behavior, but also for the recommendations and requirements for <i>how</i> it is written.
</ul>

<H2> Component Specification Files</H2>
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="project1/starters/Ordered_array.h">header file for Ordered_array.h Use as-is, no modifications allowed.</a>
<li> <a href="project1/starters/Action_item.h">header file for Action_item.h Use as-is, no modifications allowed.</a>
<li> <a href="project1/starters/skeleton_p1_globals.h">skeleton header file for p1_globals.h Add the include guards and supply the proper declarations.</a>
<li> <a href="project1/starters/strings.txt"> Output strings (text)</a> <BR>
This is a text file containing the character string constants that were used in 
the instructor's solution to generate the output message text. You can avoid 
typing errors by downloading this file and then copy-pasting these into your program.
<li> <a href="project1/starters/Makefile"> Makefile (text)</a> Uses variables to simplify changing compiler options and files.<BR>
If you are not already familiar with the Unix make utility, you can use the this makefile to get started. Note that this makefile assumes that all of your header and source files are in the same directory as the makefile. See also the main course page for links to a tutorial on makefile, the gcc documentation (including all the compiler options), and a tutorial on the Unix debugger, gdb.
</ul>

<H2> Component Demonstrations</H2>
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="project1/demos/Ordered_array_demo1.c">Ordered_array demo1 - storing a set of pointers to C-strings in order (text)</a>
<li> <a href="project1/demos/Ordered_array_demo2.c">Ordered_array demo2 - storing a set of ints in order (text)</a>
</ul>
<p>
The above are demos of how Ordered_array is supposed to be used. It illustrates how the Ordered_array functions can be used to create a set in sorted order and then print it out, and add and remove items from the set. They also show the use of function pointers and function pointer casts. 
A simple program like this is what you should use as a "test harness" to test your Ordered_array functions systematically. However, these are demos - not complete tests.

<H2>Behavior Samples</H2>
<p> The following sample behavior files illustrate the program behavior and contain
all of the different output message text strings produced by the program (see the strings.txt file). 
Your program should match these samples <b>exactly</b> so that you can be sure it is producing all of the different kinds of messages correctly. 
However, these samples are <b>not</b> a complete test of your program. Your program will be tested for a large number of other possible inputs and input sequences. 
The console interaction files are a capture of the console display during the program run. 
The stdin and stdout files are for you to use with redirected I/O. When given the stdin file, your program's stdout output should match the stdout file exactly. 
The other output files are always produced by the program, and your program should produce files that match <b>exactly</b>. 
<p>
<b>Exception to exact match:</b> These samples were obtained with a 32-bit system. The number of bytes showing in the program's memory allocation output may be larger if
you are using a 64-bit system. To see if you are matching the samples, either determine what the correct output is supposed to be for your system, 
or use compiler options to force a 32-bit compile and link. The values produced by a properly written program will be correct automatically on the autograder system.
<p>


<H3>Small Sample Behavior</H3>
<p> The following small sample illustrates the "normal" behavior of the program using a small input and contains the corresponding messages. 
Your program should reproduce the stdout and the output files exactly.
<ul>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/small_console.txt">small_console.txt</a> Console interaction <BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/small_crd.txt">small_crd.txt</a> Dictionary creation document <BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/small_dct.txt">small_dct.txt</a> Dictionary file<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/small_inp.txt">small_inp.txt</a> Input document for spell-checking<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/small_stdin.txt">small_stdin.txt</a> stdin input file<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/small_stdout.txt">small_stdout.txt</a> stdout output file<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/small_out.txt">small_out.txt</a> Output document file<BR> 
<li> <a href="project1/samples/small_dct1.txt">small_dct1.txt</a> First output dictionary file<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/small_dct2.txt">small_dct2.txt</a> Second output dictionary file. <BR> 
</ul>

<H3>Type-ahead & Errors Sample Behavior</H3>
<p> The following sample provides an extreme example of the user putting in excess whitespace and "typing ahead" 
and also shows the error messages produced by the program and how the rest of the input line is ignored after an error message. 
This sample uses the small_dct.txt and small_crd.txt sample files for input.
Your program should reproduce the stdout and the output files exactly.
<p>
Your program should get the whitespace-skipping and type-ahead capability by simple and idiomatic use of the stream input facilities; 
you should get it "automatically" - no special coding involved. 
<p> It is difficult to produce an error on opening a file for output. This sample uses ".." as an illegal output file
name. Send for help if you have trouble with producing an output file opening error on your platform.

<H3>Big Sample Behavior</H3>
<p> The following sample illustrates the behavior of the program in processing a large document (15K words). Your program should reproduce the stdout and the output files exactly.

</ul>

<H3>Length Problems Sample Behavior</H3>
The following sample illustrates the behavior of the program in processing a document that has lines and a word longer than the maximum length specified, 
and also the behavior and error message if a replacement results in a line that is too long. 

Your program should reproduce the stdout and the output files exactly.

<li> <a href="project1/samples/length_problems_out.txt">length_problems_out.txt </a> Output document file  <BR>
</ul>

<H3>Notice</H3>
<p>
These samples were obtained with a 32-bit system. The number of bytes showing in the program's memory allocation output may be larger if
you are using a 64-bit system. To see if you are matching the samples, either determine what the correct output is supposed to be for your system, 
or use compiler options to force a 32-bit compile and link. The values produced by a properly written program will be correct automatically on the autograder system.
<p>
These samples demonstrate the program behavior and are supposed to contain every possible type of output message string.
It is <b>not</b> a complete test of your program. Your program will be tested for a large number of other possible inputs and input sequences.

<H2>Other Information</H2>
<p> 
See the course web page for how to compare files and redirect I/O. In the examples directory on the file server you can find the redirect_io module that you can use to redirect I/O from a C program on 
any platform. You can use this to help test your program's output against the supplied samples. The instructions are in the header file.
<p>
See the main course page for instructions on how to set up the submission script for your CAEN account.

For a walkthrough on how to check your code before submitting and what the results of submitting should look like, see <a href="submit_example.txt">submit example</a>.

<H2>Excerpts from the Instructor's Solution</H2>
<p>
The following shows a few critical functions from the Instructor's Solution. 
Of course, there are many other equally good ways of writing this code. Compare these to your code both for general
code quality issues and to help clear up any issues about whether you code follow the specifications. Questions 
and comments are welcome. <p>
<b>Note:</b>You may use this code in your own projects in the current semester's offering of this course. 
<p>
In addition, some experimental code illustrates scanf's capabilities.
