<p class="p1"><b>Project 1 Corrections and Clarifications</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Updated 1/27/09</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Most recent items appear first</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Page numbers refer to the pdf document</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>NOTICE:</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>This document is part of the project specifications.</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Your solution must follow these corrections and clarifications.</b></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>P. 3. Paraphrase of Definitions of words, action items, and ordering</b></p>
<p class="p4"><i>The following is a different wording of the same specification; it might be more clear than the original.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">1. A word is between 2 and 31 characters long, delimited by whitespace, punctuation, or the beginning/end of a line.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">2. A word can contain only alphabetic characters except that a word can contain any number of apostrophes so long as they are not at the beginning or end of the word, in which case they are treated as punctuation.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">3. The possessive form "'s", when found at the end of a word, is removed before any operations are performed, but it is expected to be preserved in the output of any spell-checked document. A word must be at least 2 characters long after removal of "'s". Recursive removal is not expected.  "Tom's's" becomes "Tom's" rather than "Tom".</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">4.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is intended that the apostrophe be removed from the plural possessive as well, but this needs no special provision due to the basic definition of a word as defined in points #1 and #2.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">5. Words typed in different case (upper/lower) must be recognized as the same word in the dictionary. In this project, the words in the dictionary must be all lower-case, so you must convert words to lower case for use in the dictionary and to compare against the dictionary. The output document, however, should preserve the original case of correctly spelled words. For example,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the program checks the spelling of "David Kieras" as if it were "david kieras" but if correct, the output document contains "David Kieras".</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">6. The words in the action list must be kept in the exact case, which means that the program allows more than one action to be specified for the same word if they have different cases. It is possible to both skip the word "Pig" and replace "PIG" with "DOG".</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">7.To avoid confusion as to what is meant by alphabetic characters, punctuation, or whitespace, see the handout on &lt;ctype.h&gt; C Library functions for character types on the course website.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">a. Alphabetic characters are the letters A through Z, either upper or lower case, as defined by the &lt;ctype.h&gt; function isalpha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">b. The whitespace characters are defined by the function isspace.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">c. The punctuation characters are defined by ispunct.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Thus, words cannot contain numbers, whitespace, or characters like '!', and to be considered a word, a string of characters must be preceded and followed by a whitespace, punctuation, or the beginning or end of a line.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">6.Throughout this document, <i>alphabetical order</i> means in the usual alphabetical order and as defined by the strcmp function in &lt;string.h&gt; (see the handout C Library C-string functions on the course website). That is, if strcmp(s1, s2) returns a negative value, it means that s1 comes before s2 in the alphabetical order.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>P. 3, After Item #7. Word processing goes one word at a time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p4"><i>Add:</i></p>
<p class="p4">7a. The program processes the input document one word at a time; the program finds each word, checks it against the dictionary, and takes any action or queries the user, before the program goes to the next word.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>P. 9, Programming Requirements, Specific concepts and techniques. Restriction on use of memory allocation functions.</b></p>
<p class="p4"><i>After Item #11, add:</i></p>
<p class="p4">12. The only Standard C Library function you can use to allocate memory in this project is <span class="s1">malloc</span>. Other Library functions such as <span class="s1">calloc</span> or <span class="s1">realloc</span> may not be used. Also, you may not use non-Standard library functions such as <span class="s1">strdup</span> that allocate memory. You must use only <span class="s1">malloc</span> and code of your own instead.</p>
<p class="p4"><i>Explanation:</i></p>
<p class="p4">The other Standard C Library functions such as <span class="s1">calloc</span> and <span class="s1">realloc</span> are occasionally useful, but have more complex interfaces, hide some important details, and do very little more than you can do with your own code and <span class="s1">malloc</span>. <span class="s1">malloc</span> is the simplest and most basic memory allocation function, and so you will understand the concepts better by using it to allocate memory.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>P. 9, 10. Restriction on global variables does not apply to file-scope global constants defined as const variables.</b></p>
<p class="p4">For example, you can define the message strings from strings.txt with either <span class="s1">#define </span>symbols or as initial values for <span class="s1">const char * const </span>variables at file scope in the relevant <span class="s1">.c</span> file. Global const variables, since they are unmodifiable once initialized, don't have the debugging and maintenance problems of regular global variables because they can't be used as a communication channel between functions.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Conflict between Action_item enum type name and C Coding Standards.</b></p>
<p class="p4">According to the C Coding Standards, the enum should be terminated with "_e" instead of "_t". The C Coding Standards are a recent addition to the course materials, and I failed to review the project specifications in this regard.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">The Action_item.h header file was updated to use "_e" for this name as of 10:30 PM Jan. 17. If you have already written this module, use global find&amp;replace to change the name to match; if not, be sure to download the updated version of the header file.</p>
