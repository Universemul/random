<p class="p3"><b>Is create_Ordered_array supposed to dynamically allocate memory to hold an Ordered_array struct?</b></p>
<p class="p3">Review the lecture notes and answer the questions: What kind of lifetime is involved here? What kind of memory is required for this kind of lifetime?</p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>I'm having trouble understanding how the program is supposed to behave.</b></p>
<p class="p3"><b>or</b></p>
<p class="p3"><b>I'm having trouble understanding how Ordered_array is supposed to work.</b></p>
<p class="p3">First, be sure you are looking at everything that is relevant to the project specifications. See the first section of</p>
<p class="p3">http://www.engin.umich.edu/class/eecs381/admin/HowToDoWellOnProjects.pdf</p>
<p class="p3">called "Working with the Project Specifications"</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>I'm having trouble understanding the definition of a word and exactly how the spell-checking is supposed to work.</b></p>
<p class="p3">Believe it or not, a real effort has been made to keep the project as simple as possible, given what it is supposed to do. So often times, if it isn't clear what is supposed to happen, the simplest possibility is the right answer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">A good approach is to first, see the above question, and review the program's functionality (starting bottom of page 2) and study the console samples to get the big picture of how the program is supposed to behave.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Then ask yourself, "What do I need to know in order to write the code?" Lots of little nit-picky things, right? Such as, just what is a word? Try sketching what your code will do and then look to the specs to answer the specific questions as they come up.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The apostrophes are a tricky business. If you find it confusing, work out how you would identify words for spell-checking without any apostrophe's involved. Then see how you would need to modify things to take them into account.</p>

<p class="p3"><b>How do I set up a Standard C project in Apple's Xcode IDE?</b></p>
<p class="p3">See the main course web page under Programming Environment Information, Notes on using Xcode.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Can I use the Standard C Library bsearch function to search the Ordered_array?</b></p>
<p class="p3">It is permitted, but it has two disadvantages:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">1. Because bsearch is as generic as possible, it does not assume <i>anything</i> about what the array elements consist of. It does the arithmetic using the supplied parameters to figure out the address of each cell of the array, and refers to these cells with void pointers to the cells. So the comparison function is not called with elements of the array (which would be void *'s for Ordered_array), but rather with void pointers to the elements (void **'s in the case of Ordered_array). See the course website "Code Examples/C_examples" for a couple of simple examples of using bsearch to see how to set it up. The problem is that the comparison function as specified in the project documents will not work directly with bsearch.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">2. The bsearch function will tell you whether an item is in the array, and if so, where it is. But if it is not in the array, bsearch won't tell you where to put it, which of course is something that you will figure out for Ordered_array.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">These disadvantages mean that writing your own binary search function would be the better choice - see K&amp;R p. 58 for a good version to use as a starter. Note that in this version, if the item is not found, the subscript high + 1 is where it should be inserted.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p3"><b>How do I set up a Standard C project in Microsoft Visual Studio?</b></p>
<p class="p3">This information has been moved. See the main course web page under Programming Environment Information, Notes on using MS Visual Studio.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>What compiler, version, and options are being used by the autograder?</b></p>
<p class="p3">gcc 4.1.1, with compile options of</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">-ansi -pedantic -std=c89 -Wmissing-prototypes -Wall</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Especially if you are using Windows or Mac OS X, before submitting your code, you should upload to a CAEN workstation and try compiling your code with gcc 4.1.1 or a later version with the same compiler options. Test with at least the samples and check for an exact match on output to help detect any platform-specific problems.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Use the supplied makefile, or do a quick-and-dirty build as follows: make sure the only files in the current directory are the ones you plan to submit. Enter:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">gcc -ansi -pedantic -std=c89 -Wmissing-prototypes -Wall *.c</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">This will compile and link together all the source files in the directory and build an executable named a.out, which you can execute with:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">./a.out</p>
