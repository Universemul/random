<H2> Component Specification Files</H2>
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="project2/starters/skeleton_Ordered_array.h">Skeleton header file for Ordered_array.h with specification details. Modify as instructed.</a>
<li> <a href="project2/starters/skeleton_Action_item.h"> Skeleton header file for Action_item.h with specification details. Modify as instructed.</a>
<li> <a href="project2/starters/skeleton_String.h"> Skeleton header file for String.h with specification details. Modify as instructed.</a>
<li> <a href="project2/starters/skeleton_Utilities.h"> Skeleton header file for Utilities.h with specification details. Modify as instructed.</a>
<li> <a href="project2/starters/strings.txt"> Output strings (text)</a> <BR>
This is a text file containing the character string constants that were used in 
the instructor's solution to generate the output message text. You can avoid 
typing errors by downloading this file and then copy-pasting these into your program.
<li> <a href="project2/starters/Makefile"> Makefile (text)</a> Uses variables to simplify changing compiler options and files.<BR>
The recommended options for g++ in this course are specified. The no-elide-constructor option is used only for this project.
Note that this makefile assumes that all of your header and source files are in the same directory as the makefile. See also the main course page for links to a tutorial on makefile, the gcc documentation (including all the compiler options), and a tutorial on the Unix debugger, gdb.

<H2>Component Demonstrations</H2>
<ul>
<li> <a href="project2/demos/Ordered_array_demo1.cpp">Ordered_array demo1 - storing a set of simple objects in order (text)</a> <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/demos/Ordered_array_demo2.cpp">Ordered_array demo2 - Loading a set of integers which is then updated (text)</a> <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/demos/Ordered_array_demo3.cpp">Ordered_array demo3 - A more complex demo including copy construction and assignment (text)</a> <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/demos/Ordered_array_demo4.cpp">Ordered_array demo4 - A demo of using pointers in an Ordered_array, in this case to C-strings in dynamically allocated memory (text)</a> <BR>
The above are demos of how Ordered_array is supposed to be used. It illustrates how the Ordered_array functions can be used to create a set in sorted order and then print it out, and add and remove items from the set. <br>
A simple program like this is what you should use as a "test harness" to test your Ordered_array functions systematically. However, these are demos - not complete tests.
<li> <a href="project2/demos/String_demo1.cpp">String_demo1.cpp - demonstrating many features and size versus allocation values (text)</a> <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/demos/String_demo2.cpp">String_demo2.cpp - String_exceptions and error handling (text)</a> <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/demos/String_demo3.cpp">String_demo3.cpp - Demonstrating monitoring and copy construction and assignment (text)</a> <BR> Notice the instructions on how to compile under g++ with the constructor optimizations turned off to get the "normal" pattern of calls to the copy constructor.
<BR>The above are demos of how String is supposed to be used, and illustrate typical behavior. <br>
A simple program like this is what you should use as a "test harness" to test your String functions systematically. However, these are demos - not complete tests.

<H2>Behavior Samples</H2>
<p>
Since Project 2 has the same functionality as Project 1, its behavior is almost identical. These samples should
be identical to those of Project 1 except for the memory allocation output.
<p>
<H3>Small Sample Behavior</H3>
<p> The following small sample illustrates the "normal" behavior of the program using a small input and contains the corresponding messages. 
Your program should reproduce the stdout and the output files exactly.
<ul>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/small_console.txt">small_console.txt</a> Console interaction <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/small_crd.txt">small_crd.txt</a> Dictionary creation document <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/small_dct.txt">small_dct.txt</a> Dictionary file<BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/small_inp.txt">small_inp.txt</a> Input document for spell-checking<BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/small_stdin.txt">small_stdin.txt</a> stdin input file<BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/small_stdout.txt">small_stdout.txt</a> stdout output file<BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/small_out.txt">small_out.txt</a> Output document file<BR> 
<li> <a href="project2/samples/small_dct1.txt">small_dct1.txt</a> First output dictionary file<BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/small_dct2.txt">small_dct2.txt</a> Second output dictionary file. <BR> 
</ul>

<H3>Type-ahead & Errors Sample Behavior</H3>
<p> The following sample provides an extreme example of the user putting in excess whitespace and "typing ahead" 
and also shows the error messages produced by the program and how the rest of the input line is ignored after an error message. 
This sample uses the small_dct.txt and small_crd.txt sample files for input.
Your program should reproduce the stdout and the output files exactly.
<p>
Your program should get the whitespace-skipping and type-ahead capability by simple and idiomatic use of the stream input facilities; 
you should get it "automatically" - no special coding involved. 
<p> It is difficult to produce an error on opening a file for output. This sample uses ".." as an illegal output file
name. Send for help if you have trouble with producing an output file opening error on your platform.
<ul>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/ta_errors_console.txt">ta_errors_console.txt </a> Console interaction <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/ta_errors_inp.txt">ta_errors_inp.txt </a> Input  document for spell-checking <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/ta_errors_stdin.txt">ta_errors_stdin.txt </a> stdin input file <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/ta_errors_stdout.txt">ta_errors_stdout.txt </a> stdout output file <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/ta_errors_out.txt">ta_errors_out.txt </a> Output document file  <BR> 
<li> <a href="project2/samples/ta_errors_dct.txt">ta_errors_dct.txt </a> Output dictionary file  <BR>
</ul>

<H3>Big Sample Behavior</H3>
<p> The following sample illustrates the behavior of the program in processing a large document (15K words). Your program should reproduce the stdout and the output files exactly.
<ul>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/big_console.txt">big_console.txt </a> Console interaction  <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/big_stdin.txt">big_stdin.txt </a> stdin input file  <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/big_stdout.txt">big_stdout.txt </a> stdout output file <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/big_crd.txt">big_crd.txt </a> Dictionary creation document  <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/big_inp.txt">big_inp.txt </a> Input document for spell-checking  <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/big_dct.txt">big_dct.txt </a> Output dictionary file  <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/big_out.txt">big_out.txt </a> Output document file  <BR>
</ul>

<p> The following sample illustrates the behavior of the program in processing a document that has lines and a word longer than Project 1 could handle. 
There aren't supposed to be any length problems with Project 2; the names of these samples are 
just to relate them to the corresponding samples in Project 1. Your program should reproduce the stdout and the output files exactly.
<ul>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/length_problems_console.txt">length_problems_console.txt </a> Console interaction  length_problems_console.txt<BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/length_problems_stdin.txt">length_problems_stdin.txt </a> stdin input file  <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/length_problems_stdout.txt">length_problems_stdout.txt </a> stdout output file  <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/length_problems_dct.txt">length_problems_dct.txt </a> Dictionary document  <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/length_problems_crd.txt">length_problems_crd.txt </a> Dictionary creation document  <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/length_problems_inp.txt">length_problems_inp.txt </a> Input document for spell-checking  <BR>
<li> <a href="project2/samples/length_problems_out.txt">length_problems_out.txt </a> Output document file  <BR>
</ul>

<H3>Notice</H3>
<p>
These samples were obtained with a 32-bit system. The number of bytes showing in the program's memory allocation output may be larger if
you are using a 64-bit system. To see if you are matching the samples, either determine what the correct output is supposed to be for your system, 
or use compiler options to force a 32-bit compile and link. The values produced by a properly written program will be correct automatically on the autograder system.
<p>
These samples demonstrate the program behavior and are supposed to contain every possible type of output message string.
It is <b>not</b> a complete test of your program. Your program will be tested for a large number of other possible inputs and input sequences.

<H2>Other Information</H2>
<p> 
See the course web page for how to compare files and redirect I/O. In the examples directory on the file server you can find the redirect_io module that you can use to redirect I/O from a C program on 
any platform. You can use this to help test your program's output against the supplied samples. The instructions are in the header file.

<H2>Excerpts from the Instructor's Solution</H2>
<p>
The following shows a few critical functions from the Instructor's Solution. 
Of course, there are many other equally good ways of writing this code. Compare these to your code both for general
code quality issues and to help clear up any issues about whether you code follow the specifications. Questions 
and comments are welcome. <p>
<b>Note:</b>You may use this code in your own projects in the current semester's offering of this course.
