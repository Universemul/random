<H2>Exam Information</H2>
<ul>
<!-- 

<li> The Midterm exam will be held during the regular class time on Thursday Feb. 18, starting at 3:00 PM, ending at 4:30 PM. 
<li> We have two rooms. If your last name starts with M-Z, come to the regular classroom. If A-L, go to 1017 DOW. 

<li> The rooms will have plenty of space; please leave at least one seat between you and each other person. 
If more than one person needs to be in a row, please move into the middle of rows so that later arrivals can find a place easily.

<li> Please place all backpacks, etc on the floor before the exam starts. 
<li> Use of computational or data-access devices of any sort will be neither necessary nor allowed during the exam. 
All required paper will be provided. The only equipment you need to bring is a pen or pencil and your hopefully rested and well-loaded brain.
<li> The exam will be closed-book, closed-notes. It will be short enough that time pressure will probably not be an issue for most people. 
<li> Coverage will be everything up to and including the Feb. 16 lecture topic and readings (up to but not including Inheritance). 
<li> While some questions may be about low-level coding issues, by far the emphasis will be on concepts and 
understanding the "why" and "how does it work." 
<li> Consult the sample questions to see what the exam questions will be like in terms of style. Note especially 
the emphasis on avoiding guessing on the multiple-choice format questions.
<li> Since my posted lecture notes cover what I think is most important, using them as a study guide would be a good idea. 
<li> Another guideline for study is to make sure you understand the "why" of what you were supposed to do in the projects. 
If you weren't sure of something, spend some time on it. 
Examples: 
<ul>
<li>Why the opaque types in Project 1 have to be allocated with malloc instead of declared as local variables. 
<li>Why a "using" statement in a header file is forbidden. 
<li>Why you had to put all of your Project 2 container code in the header file.
<li>Why copy-swap was a good way to write an assignment operator in your String class.
<li>Why a stream iterator can be used to have the copy algorithm dump the contents of a container to a stream. 
</ul>
<li> The conceptual discussions in the project assignments also cover key "why" concepts - it would be good to review these. 
<li> If you have a friend in the course, a good way to prepare for the exam would be to practice explaining the concepts to each other. 
For example, what happens when an exception is thrown?
-->
<li> The Final Exam will be held Friday, April 23, starting at 4:00 PM, ending at 6:00 PM.
<li> We have two rooms. If your last name starts with A-L, come to the regular classroom. If M-Z, go to 1010 DOW. 
<li> The room(s) will have plenty of space; please leave at least one seat between you and each other person, and move into 
the middle of rows so that later arrivals can find a place easily.
<li> Please place all backpacks, books, etc on the floor before the exam starts. 
<li> Use of computational or data-access devices of any sort will be neither necessary nor allowed during the exam. All required paper will be provided. 
The only equipment you need to bring is a pen or pencil and your hopefully rested and well-loaded brain.
<li> The exam will be closed-book, closed-notes. It will probably be short enough that time pressure will not be an issue for most people. 
<li> Coverage will be everything in the course, but by far will emphasize the material since the midterm, starting with inheritance. 
<li> The final exam will be very similar to the midterm, so reviewing your midterm and studying the sample questions will give you 
the best idea about what the exam will be like in terms of style. 
<li>Since my lecture notes cover what I think is most important, using them as a study guide would be a good idea. 
<li> Another guideline for study is to make sure you understand the "why" of what you were supposed to do in the projects. 
If you weren't sure of something, spend some time on it. 
<li> The conceptual discussions in the project assignments also cover key "why" concepts - it would be good to review these. 
<li>If you haven't already, studying your midterm and understanding why the marked correct answers are correct would be a good preparation as well. 
<li> If you have a friend in the course, a good way to prepare for the exam would be to practice explaining the concepts to each other. 
For example, what order of constructor calls happen when you create an object of a leaf class in an inheritance tree? What's the principle?

These questions are drawn from previous midterms and finals. This is not intended as a study guide because the questions
