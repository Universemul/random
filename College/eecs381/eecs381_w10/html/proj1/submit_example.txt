I logged into login.engin.umich.edu, and uploaded my source code to a new directory Private/p1v0. This directory contained the Makefile and the exact set of .h and .c files that I wanted to submit. 

aen-vnc03% cd p1v0
caen-vnc03% ls
Collection.c  Ordered_container_array.c  p1_globals.c  Record.c   Utility.h
Collection.h  Ordered_container.h        p1_globals.h  Record.h
Makefile      Ordered_container_list.c   p1_main.c     Utility.c

I did a build with a make command to check that all files needed were present: 

caen-vnc03% make

To help check that I didn't have platform-dependent code (especially important if you develop with Visual Studio), I then uploaded the samples and my other test files to that same directory and used I/O redirection and diff or sdiff to check that on the engin platform my program appeared to be working correctly. (sdiff is handier to see how the files are different: it shows lines from the two files side-by-side, with mismatching lines marked). For example:

caen-vnc03% ./p1Lexe <normal_in.txt >testL_out.txt
caen-vnc03% diff normalL_out.txt testL_out.txt
caen-vnc03% ./p1Aexe <normal_in.txt >testA_out.txt
caen-vnc03% diff normalA_out.txt testA_out.txt
caen-vnc03% diff normalL_out.txt normalA_out.txt

This last check should show differences only in the number of allocated items - a good "sanity check" that the program is behaving consistently with the two implementations.

Then after checking to be sure that I had no extraneous .h or .c files present, I submitted all of the .h and .c files, thus making sure that I got everything included. Notice exactly what the response of the submission script is. 

caen-vnc03% ls *.h
Collection.h  Ordered_container.h  p1_globals.h  Record.h  Utility.h
caen-vnc03% ls *.c
Collection.c               Ordered_container_list.c  p1_main.c  Utility.c
Ordered_container_array.c  p1_globals.c              Record.c
caen-vnc03% submit381 1 *.h *.c

You are about to submit the following files:
	Collection.h
	Ordered_container.h
	p1_globals.h

	Collection.c
	Ordered_container_array.c
	Ordered_container_list.c
	p1_globals.c
	p1_main.c
	Record.c
	Utility.c

Submit these files? Type y or RETURN to submit, anything else to abort: y

Mailed:	Collection.h
	Ordered_container.h
	p1_globals.h
	Record.h

	Collection.c

You should receive an email acknowledgement from eecs381@grader8.eecs.umich.edu
for this submission.  Look over the acknowledgement to make sure you submitted
the correct source code file(s) (e.g. that it's not the object or executable
file, etc.).

If you don't see this output, something is wrong (for example, maybe the software on the machine isn't complete). Try a different machine or email us for help. If everything is OK, you should get an email sent to your uniqname@umich.edu with the autograder response. When the load is heavy, this can take several minutes. Review the other web pages about the autograder and how to deal with it. It is most important not to submit again until you have received a response. If the response seems to be badly delayed, send to eecs381help. Include specifics of what machine you did the submission from and when you submitted it.
