The project documents will be added to this page as they become available. If you get a page that says "not yet available," 
it should become available in the future. Ask about it only if we announced that it was supposed to be available.
<p>
<b>Note:</b>Files listed as "pdf" can be viewed or downloaded and printed
at high-quality with Adobe's Acrobat Reader. 
<p>
Files listed as text are plain ASCII text files. The should display in your
browser with correct formatting, but can also be downloaded from the course
file server; downloading with an ftp utility set to ASCII text mode is recommended for code and sample 
files to avoid problems involved with platform-specific end-of-line differences.

<H2>Documents</H2>
<ul>
<li> <a href="project1/doc.pdf">Project Document (pdf)</a>
<li> <a href="corrections.html">Project Corrections & Clarifications</a>
<li> <a href="FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a>
<li> <a href="samplequalitychecklist.pdf">Sample Code Quality Checklist (pdf)</a><br>
When your code is evaluated for quality, it will be done using a checklist 
similar to this one. Try to make your code have these general properties and the specific properties 
discussed in lecture, the project specifications, and the C Coding Standards document on the course home page. 
Overall: Check your code not just for behavior, but also for the recommendations and 
requirements for <i>how it is written</i>.
</ul>
<H2> Component Specification Files</H2>
<p>
The header files below should be downloaded and used in your project as-is, without modification. These define the modules and their interfaces. 
The comments in these files provide essential details on what each module and function does. <BR>
The source files named with "skeleton" provide code that your project must use, but you will add your own code to complete the file. 
See the comments in the file for instructions.
<ul>
<li> <a href="project1/starters/Ordered_container.h">Ordered_container.h header file</a>
<li> <a href="project1/starters/Record.h">Record.h header file</a>
<li> <a href="project1/starters/Record_skeleton.c">Record.c skeleton file</a>
<li> <a href="project1/starters/Collection.h">Collection.h header file</a>
<li> <a href="project1/starters/Collection_skeleton.c">Collection.c skeleton file</a>
<li> <a href="project1/starters/p1_globals_skeleton.h">p1_globals_skeleton.h header file</a><BR>
Use the specified names for the global variables in this project.
<li> <a href="project1/starters/strings.txt"> strings.txt (text)</a> <BR>
This is a text file containing the character string constants that were used in 
the instructor's solution to generate the output message text. You can avoid 
typing errors by downloading this file and then copy-pasting the strings into your program.
</ul>
<H2> Additional Starter Files</H2>
<p>
The following files are useful, but are not part of the specifications.
<ul>
<li> <a href="project1/starters/Makefile"> Makefile suitable for Project 1 (text)</a> <BR>
If you are not already familiar with the Unix make utility, you can use the this makefile to get started. 
Note that this makefile assumes that all of your header and source files are in the same directory as the makefile. 
See also the main course page for links to a tutorial on makefile, the gcc documentation (including all the compiler options), 
and a tutorial on the Unix debugger, gdb.
<li> <a href="project1/demos/Ordered_container_demo1.c">Ordered_container_demo1.c (text)</a> <BR>
A demo of how to use Ordered_container module which illustrates the following:
<ul>
<li> How to create a container, supplying an ordering function, to hold pointers to string constants.
<li> How to fill the container.
<li> How to print out, search, and change the contents.  
<li> How to cast pointers to items and data objects to/from the void * type.
<li> The use of function pointers and function pointer casts.
</ul>
A simple program like this is what you should use as a "test harness" to test your list functions systematically, starting with the simple ones. 
<p>
<li> <a href="project1/demos/Ordered_container_demo2.c">Ordered_container_demo2.c (text)</a> <BR>
This demo is similar to the previous one, but shows how to use the container with pointers to a simple structure type, and uses casts inside
the functions rather than in the calls to do the casts to/from void * types.

</ul>
<H2>Behavior Samples</H2>
<p>
The following sample behavior files illustrate the program behavior and contain
all of the different output message text strings produced by the program (see the strings.txt file). 
Your program should match these samples <b>exactly</b> so that you can be sure it is producing all of the different kinds of messages correctly. 
However, these samples are <b>not</b> a complete test of your program. 
Your program will be tested for a large number of other possible inputs and input sequences. 
<p>
The console interaction files are a capture of the console display during the program run. 
The _in.txt and _out.txt files are for you to use with redirected I/O. When given the _in.txt file, your program's stdout output should match the _out.txt file exactly. The other output files are written during the  by the program, and your program should produce files that match <b>exactly</b> with these samples. 
<p> 
The following sample illustrates the "normal" behavior of the program and contains the corresponding messages. 
Your program should reproduce the output files exactly.
<p> There are output files for the two different implementations, showing that the only difference in program behavior is the items-allocated values.
<ul>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/normalA_console.txt"> normalA_console.txt</a> Normal behavior console interaction using Array implementation<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/normalL_console.txt"> normalL_console.txt</a> Normal behavior console interaction using List implementation (text)<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/normal_in.txt"> normal_in.txt</a>  Normal behavior stdin input file (same for both implementations) <BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/normalA_out.txt"> normalA_out.txt</a> Normal behavior stdout output file using Array implementation<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/normalL_out.txt"> normalL_out.txt</a> Normal behavior stdout output file using List implementation (text) <BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/savefile1.txt"> savefile1.txt</a> Normal behavior save file  (same for both implementations) <BR>
</ul>
<p> 
The following sample shows the error messages produced by the program. 
Your program should reproduce the output file exactly. These are the same for both implementations.
<ul>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/badfile.txt"> badfile.txt</a> A bogus "save" file for the restore command that contains invalid data for demonstration purposes<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/errors_console.txt"> errors_console.txt</a> Errors behavior console interaction<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/errors_in.txt"> errors_in.txt</a> Errors behavior stdin input file<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/errors_out.txt"> errors_out.txt</a> Errors behavior stdout output file<BR>
</ul>

<p> 
The following sample illustrates the behavior of the program when you input strings that are too long, excess whitespace and use "type-ahead." 
Your program should reproduce the stdout files exactly. <ul>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/typeahead_console.txt"> typeahead_console.txt</a> Type-ahead behavior console interaction<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/typeahead_in.txt"> typeahead_in.txt</a> Type-ahead behavior stdin input file<BR>
<li> <a href="project1/samples/typeahead_out.txt"> typeahead_out.txt</a>Type-ahead behavior stdout output file<BR>
</ul>

<p>
These samples demonstrate the program behavior and are supposed to contain every possible type of output message string so that you can prevent your autograder score from being affected by spelling errors and typos.
<p>
<b>These samples are not a complete test of your program!!!</b> Your program will be tested for a large number of other possible inputs and input sequences. You must devise your own complete test set to find the bugs in your code.
<p>
The console outputs are a saved copy of a 
console window after entering the commands by hand. The stdin input file is suitable for redirecting input, and the stdout output can be compared with the redirected output of your program.  Your program should match the stdout output.
<p> 
See the course web page for how to compare files and redirect I/O. In the examples directory on the file server you can find the redirect_io module that you can use to redirect I/O from a C program on 
any platform. You can use this to help test your program's output against the supplied samples. The instructions are in the header file.
<p>
</ul>

<H2>Autograder submission and responses</H2>
<p>
It is a good idea to test on your components as you develop them (see the project document). You can get an autograder evaluation
of the components before you have finished the entire project. To do this, submit ALL of the required project files, even if they are empty.
The autograder will build and test whatever parts of the program that it can - see the explanation of the autograder feedback below. Notice that
the component tests generally will not work unless your p1_globals module is correct.
<p>
For a walkthrough on how to check your code before submitting and what the results of submitting should look like, see <a href="submit_example.txt">submit example</a>.

<H2>Code Quality Evaluation</H2>
<p>
Code quality was evaluated only for those project whose autograder score was at least 80% of the maximum autograder score, as described in the 
syllabus. For those whose projects did not meet this threshold, the evaluation summary is <a href="p1checklist.pdf">available here</a>. To use it, assess your code on each item
comparing it with the Coding Standards document and other course material (especially the posted lecture notes). After you have completed this process, 
see the instructor for further discussion and explanation.
