<p class="p1"><b>Project 2 Corrections and Clarifications</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Updated 2/10/10</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Most recent items appear first</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Page numbers refer to the pdf document</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>NOTICE:</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>This document is part of the project specifications.</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Your solution must follow these corrections and clarifications.</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>strings.txt starter file. Disregard "Enter data file name: ".</b></p>
<p class="p3">This is a residue of an earlier version that prompted for the filename. Please delete from your copy or ignore.</p>
<p class="p4"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Record skeleton header, specification comment for constructor with a stream argument. Specification for reading input into variables is too vague.</b></p>
<p class="p3">The specification in question is:</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>// Where appropriate, input is read directly into member variables.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Now,if you use getline to read the title from the file directly into the String member variable for the title, the member variable will have a final allocation resulting from the doubling rule. This means that the total String allocation will be different (larger) than if you use getline to read the title from the file into a local String variable and then assign it to the title member variable.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The instructor's solution used a general-purpose title reading function that skips leading whitespace, checks the contents read by getline to eliminate extra spaces, and finally returns the cleaned up title by value, and then stores that in the member variable, resulting in the title member variable occupying minimum allocation. Perhaps this is overkill, but reading the title is such a cranky process that I thought I should put in a function, overlooking that this was inconsistent with the specification which was also vague - "Where appropriate" - what does this mean?</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Rather than change the posted samples and autograder tests at this late date, or risk further confusion, the specification is hereby changed as follows:</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Change:</i></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>// Where appropriate, input is read directly into member variables.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>To:</i></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>// Input is read directly into member variables, except for the title,</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>// which is read into a local String variable, processed if necessary,</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>// and then assigned to the title member variable.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><i>Note: </i>The specified behavior of getline for String is <i>not</i> changed.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>P. 6, third paragraph, last sentence about String module. String does not need the Error class.</b></p>
<p class="p3">It has its own exception class.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Change:</i></p>
<p class="p3">So that we can test it by itself, your String implementation should depend only on Utility.h to get access to the Error declaration for use in throwing an exception and the swapem function template (see below).</p>
<p class="p3"><i>To:</i></p>
<p class="p3">So that we can test it by itself, your String implementation should depend only on Utility.h to get access to the swapem function template (see below).</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>skeleton_Collection.h: residue of earlier version in declaration of operator&lt;&lt;.</b></p>
<p class="p3"><i>Change:</i></p>
<p class="p3">std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (std::ostream&amp; os, const Meeting&amp; meeting);</p>
<p class="p3"><i>To:</i></p>
<p class="p3">std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (std::ostream&amp; os, const Collection&amp; Collection);</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Explanation:</i></p>
<p class="p3">For speed, I used a file from an earlier project as a starter for this file, and failed to change everything. A corrected version was uploaded at about 8:00 PM 2/5/10. Either make this change or download a fresh version of the starter file.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Page 4, top, last bullet under "you may not modify the public interface" that starts on Page 3. Clarification.</b></p>
<p class="p3">You can't add any top-level, non-member, or public functions, classes or declarations to the header file. You can add <i>private</i> functions, classes, or declarations.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Change:</i></p>
<p class="p3">No other functions, classes, or declarations can be added to the class header file</p>
<p class="p3"><i>To:</i></p>
<p class="p3">Only private functions, classes, or declarations can be added to the class header file.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Page 4, first paragraph about the String class. You can modify much more about the contents of the String.</b></p>
<p class="p3"><i>Change:</i></p>
<p class="p3">You can't modify the contents of a String except to change an existing character, add more characters to the end, or replace the whole contents with something else.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>To:</i></p>
<p class="p3">In addition, you can modify the contents of a String in a variety of ways: you can change single characters, remove multiple characters, and insert additional characters.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Explanation:</i></p>
<p class="p3">Version drift while developing the project - it is good to have more choices to condense the title, but the document didn't keep up. This does not mean that you are required to use all of these functions in the main project code; they do have to work correctly for component testing, however.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Page 5, top, next-to-last line of example code is confusing.</b></p>
<p class="p3">A line was wrapped, making part of a comment look like a part of the code which makes no sense. It was supposed to be part of a function prototype.</p>
<p class="p3"><i>Change:</i></p>
<p class="p5">str2 = foo(str1); // where foo etc</p>
<p class="p5">cout &lt;&lt; str2 &lt;&lt; endl;</p>
<p class="p3"><i>To:</i></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">/</span>/ foo is declared as:</p>
<p class="p5">// String foo(String);</p>
<p class="p5">// and so uses String in call and return by value.</p>
<p class="p5">str2 = foo(str1);</p>
<p class="p5">cout &lt;&lt; str2 &lt;&lt; endl;</p>
