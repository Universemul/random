By using an ftp utility and transfering these files in ASCII text mode, you can be sure of getting a valid copy of the files without the possible confusions produced by the fact that DOS/Windows, MacOS, and Unix all follow different rules for marking line endings.<P>The course file server is in CAEN's afs space at:<br><b>/afs/umich.edu/class/eecs381</b><br>You should be able to connect to this via ftp from either CAEN or ITD accounts.<p>Files for a project will be in a directory whose name starts with "project"; look for example code in the "examples" directory.
