You do nothave to develop your programs with Unix (in fact, we encourage you to useone of the IDEs), but you do have to use Unix to submit your project.<HR><H2>Setting up your Unix account to use the EECS 381 submission program</H2>In order to use the submission program, you must tell your shell where tofind it.  You only need to do this once.<P><OL><LI> <B>Login to a CAEN or ITD Unix machine</B><BR>   Sit down at a Unix machine in one of the labs, or use telnet to connect   to e.g. <A HREF="telnet://azure.engin.umich.edu">azure.engin.umich.edu</A>   or <A HREF="telnet://login.itd.umich.edu">login.itd.umich.edu</A>.<BR>&nbsp;<LI> <B>Open your .cshrc file in a text editor</B><BR>   Use pico, vi, emacs, nedit, or your favorite text editor.  E.g. type   "pico ~/.cshrc" at the shell prompt (machinename%).  Your .cshrc file   contains commands that are run every time you start a new shell.<BR>&nbsp;<LI> <B>Add the EECS 381 directory to your path</B><BR>   Copy this line to the end of your .cshrc file:        <BLOCKQUOTE>        <KBD>set path = ($path /afs/engin.umich.edu/class/perm/eecs381/bin)</KBD>	<P>        </BLOCKQUOTE>   This command tells your shell where to find the submit381 program.<BR>&nbsp;<LI> <B>Logout, then login again</B><BR>   Your new .cshrc file will run when you login.</OL>Note: If your shell is not csh or tcsh, you will have to make changes to   your shell initialization files.  If you know how to change your shell,   you can probably figure out how to make these changes yourself.<HR><H2>Using the EECS 381 submission program</H2>Follow this procedure every time you turn in a project.<P><OL><LI> <B>Copy your project source (.cpp and .h) file(s) to your Unix (AFS)        directory</B><BR>   You can use FTP, or access AFS through a lab PC (drive H:) or Mac (use   the Chooser).  You must give your source file(s) the exact filenames   that are specified, with the same case.  Depending on your upload method,you may need to ensure that your files are converted to Unix line-ending format from whatever your development platform format is.<BR>&nbsp; <LI> <B>Login to a CAEN or ITD Unix machine</B><BR>   Sit down at a Unix machine in one of the labs, or use telnet to connect   to e.g. <A HREF="telnet://azure.engin.umich.edu">azure.engin.umich.edu</A>   or <A HREF="telnet://login.itd.umich.edu">login.itd.umich.edu</A>.<BR>&nbsp;<LI> <B>Make sure your source files are in your current directory and have        the specified names</B><BR>   Use the "ls" command to list the files in your current directory.  If   your source files are not in your current directory, either change   directories ("cd") or move your source files ("mv").  If your source   files have the wrong names, rename them ("mv"). <BR>&nbsp;<LI> <B>Verify that your program compiles and runs correctly in a Unix environment</B><BR>   Why waste a submission if you could have found out that your program   had a compilation error before you submitted it?  Refer to the   <A HREF="../progenvs/unix/"> Unix C++ Information</A> pages on the   course web site. It is also a good idea to run your program using the sample inputs and outputs - this is a good way to detect the common error of relying on undefined platform-specific behavior.<BR>&nbsp;<LI> <B>Run the submit381 program</B><BR>   At the shell prompt, type        <BLOCKQUOTE>        <KBD>submit381 &lt;project-number&gt &lt;source-file-names&gt;</KBD>	<P>        </BLOCKQUOTE>   e.g.        <BLOCKQUOTE>        <KBD>submit381 1 P1.cpp</KBD>	<P>        <KBD>submit381 0 hello.cpp hello.h</KBD>	<P>        </BLOCKQUOTE>   You can use shell <A HREF="http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/technotes/CAEN304_AdvancedUnix.html#HEADING1-5">   wildcards</A> to make typing the submit command easier and less   error-prone.  Just be sure your current directory has only the files that you plan to submit, because this will send all .h and .cpp files in your current directory:         <BLOCKQUOTE>        <KBD>submit381 4 *.cpp *.h</KBD>	<P>        </BLOCKQUOTE>   Remember that unix is case-sensitive so "hello.cpp" != "Hello.cpp".</OL>Note: You can type "submit381" without arguments to see a reminder of how   to use it. <HR><!-- need to document query feature --><P>The EECS 381 submission program also supports a query feature.  The queryfeature is intended to allow you to get your score after the due date without re-submitting.  The syntax is:</P><UL>submit381 -q <project-number></UL><P>The autograder will email you a copy of the score readout for the lastsubmission received.  You may not query your score if you have alreadysubmitted that day.  </P></BODY></HTML>
