If you get a page that says "not yet available," it should become available in the future. Ask about it only if we announced that it was supposed to be available.<p><b>Note:</b>Files listed as "pdf" can be viewed or downloaded and printedat high-quality with Adobe's Acrobat Reader. <p>Files listed as text are plain ASCII text files. The should display in yourbrowser with correct formatting, but can also be downloaded from the coursefile server; downloading with an ftp utility set to ASCII text mode is recommended for code and sample files to avoid line-ending problems.<hr><p><H2>Documents</H2><ul><li> <a href="project5/doc.pdf">Project Document (pdf)</a><li> <a href="corrections.html">Project Corrections & Clarifications</a><li> <a href="FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a></ul><H2> Component Specification Files</H2><p><ul><li> <a href="project5/starters/p5_main.cpp"> p5_main.cpp - you must use this file as-is.</a><li> <a href="project5/starters/mem_fun_code.txt">Want to use for_each(... mem_fun()) on a container of Smart_Pointers?

You can avoid typing errors by downloading this file and then copy-pasting these into your program. This file contains only the strings new to Project 5; Project 4's are still used elsewhere,as specified in the Project 4 "starter" files.</ul><p> <H2>Behavior Samples</H2><p> The following sample behavior files illustrate the program behavior and containall of the different output message text strings produced by the program that appear only in Project 5. You can adapt the samples from Project 4 to provide a regression sample to illustrate that your program still behaves like Project 4 in other respects (but notice that your final version should not output the constructor and destructor messages). Your program should match your adapted Project 4 samples and the samples below <b>exactly</b> so that you can be sure it is producing all of the different kinds of messages correctly. However, these samples are <b>not</b> a complete test of your program. Your program will be tested for a large number of other possible inputs and input sequences. The console interaction files are a capture of the console display during the program run. The _in.txt and _out.txt files are for you to use with redirected I/O. When given the _in.tx file redirected to cin, your program's cout redirected to a file should match the _out.txt file exactly.<p> The following sample illustrates the behavior of the program when "status" is used after almost every "go" command, with no "show" commands. It is similar to Project 4's sample, but shows the new Cruiser behavior and the different time course for Ship sinking. Your program should reproduce the output file exactly.<ul><li> <a href="project5/samples/status_console.txt"> Status Sample Behavior console interaction (text)</a> status_console.txt<BR><li> <a href="project5/samples/status_in.txt"> Status Sample Behavior input file (text)</a> status_in.txt<BR><li> <a href="project5/samples/status_out.txt"> Status Sample Behavior output file (text)</a> status_out.txt<BR></ul><p> The following sample illustrates the behavior of the program with the Cruise_ship and no views. Your program should reproduce the output file exactly.<ul><li> <a href="project5/samples/cruise_console.txt"> Cruise Ship Sample Behavior console interaction (text)</a> cruise_console.txt<BR><li> <a href="project5/samples/cruise_in.txt"> Cruise Ship Sample Behavior input file (text)</a> cruise_in.txt<BR><li> <a href="project5/samples/cruise_out.txt"> Cruise Ship Sample Behavior output file (text)</a> cruise_out.txt<BR></ul><p> The following sample shows the output produced by the program for different views, along with the related error messages. This sample shows the bridge view for a sunken ship. Your program should reproduce the output files exactly. Notice the plural: Views, not View.<ul><li> <a href="project5/samples/views_console.txt"> Views Sample Behavior console interaction (text)</a> views_console.txt<BR><li> <a href="project5/samples/views_in.txt"> Views Sample Behavior input file (text)</a> views_in.txt<BR><li> <a href="project5/samples/views_out.txt"> Views Sample Behavior output file (text)</a> views_out.txt<BR></ul><p>These samples demonstrate the program behavior and are supposed to contain every possible type of output message.It is <b>not</b> a complete test of your program. Your program will be tested for a large number of other possible inputs and input sequences.The console outputs are a saved copy of a console (shell) window after entering the commands by hand. The _in input file is suitable for redirecting input, and the _out output can be compared with the redirected output of your program.  Your program should match the stdout output.<!--<H2>Other Information</H2><p> <p> At the top level of the file server you can find the redirect_io module that you can use to redirect I/O from a C++ program on any platform. You can use this to help test your program's output against the supplied samples. The instructions are in the header file.<p><p></UL>--><p></UL></body></html>
