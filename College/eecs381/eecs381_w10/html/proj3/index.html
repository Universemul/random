<p>
The project documents will be added to this page as they become available. If you get a page that says "not yet available," 
it should become available in the future. Ask about it only if we announced that it was supposed to be available.
<p>
<b>Note:</b>Files listed as "pdf" can be viewed or downloaded and printed
at high-quality with Adobe's Acrobat Reader. 
<p>
Files listed as text are plain ASCII text files. The should display in your
browser with correct formatting, but can also be downloaded from the course
file server; downloading with an ftp utility set to ASCII text mode is recommended for code and sample 
files to avoid problems involved with platform-specific end-of-line differences.

<li> <a href="project3/doc.pdf">Project Document (pdf)</a>
<li> <a href="corrections.html">Project Corrections & Clarifications</a>

<H2> Component Specification Files</H2>
<ul>
<li> <a href="project3/starters/strings.txt"> strings.txt (text)</a> <BR>
This is a text file containing the character string constants that were used in 
the instructor's solution to generate the output message text. You can avoid 
typing errors by downloading this file and then copy-pasting the strings into your program.
</ul>

<H2>Behavior Samples</H2>
<p>
The following sample behavior files illustrate the program behavior and contain
all of the different output message text strings produced by the program (see the strings.txt file). 
Your program should match these samples <b>exactly</b> so that you can be sure it is producing all of the different kinds of messages correctly. 
However, these samples are <b>not</b> a complete test of your program. 
Your program will be tested for a large number of other possible inputs and input sequences. 
<p>
The console interaction files are a capture of the console display during the program run. 
The _in.txt and _out.txt files are for you to use with redirected I/O. When given the _in.txt file, your program's stdout output should match the _out.txt file exactly. The other output files are written during the  by the program, and your program should produce files that match <b>exactly</b> with these samples. 
<p> 
The following sample illustrates the "normal" behavior of the program using the old commands only, and contains the corresponding messages. 
This is very similar to project 2.
Your program should reproduce the output files exactly.
<ul>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/normal_console.txt"> normal_console.txt</a> Normal behavior console interaction (text)<BR>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/normal_in.txt"> normal_in.txt</a>  Normal behavior stdin input file <BR>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/normal_out.txt"> normal_out.txt</a> Normal behavior stdout output file (text) <BR>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/savefile1.txt"> savefile1.txt</a> Normal behavior save file <BR>
</ul>
<p> 
The following sample shows the error messages produced by the program using only the old commands; these are teh same as Project 2. 
Your program should reproduce the output file exactly.
<ul>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/badfile.txt"> badfile.txt</a> A bogus "save" file for the restore command that contains invalid data for demonstration purposes<BR>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/errors_console.txt"> errors_console.txt</a> Errors behavior console interaction<BR>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/errors_in.txt"> errors_in.txt</a> Errors behavior stdin input file<BR>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/errors_out.txt"> errors_out.txt</a> Errors behavior stdout output file<BR>
</ul>

<p> 
The following sample illustrates the behavior of the program when you input strings that are very long, excess whitespace and use "type-ahead." 
Only the old commands are used, so this is the same as project 2.
Your program should reproduce the stdout files exactly. 
<ul>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/typeahead_console.txt"> typeahead_console.txt</a> Type-ahead behavior console interaction<BR>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/typeahead_in.txt"> typeahead_in.txt</a> Type-ahead behavior stdin input file<BR>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/typeahead_out.txt"> typeahead_out.txt</a>Type-ahead behavior stdout output file<BR>
</ul>

<p> 
The following sample illustrates the behavior of the program using the new commands and their messages and error messages.
Your program should reproduce the stdout files exactly. 
<ul>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/new_commands_console.txt"> new_commands_console.txt</a> New command behavior console interaction<BR>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/new_commands_in.txt"> new_commands_in.txt</a> New command behavior stdin input file<BR>
<li> <a href="project3/samples/new_commands_out.txt"> new_commands_out.txt</a> New command behavior stdout output file<BR>
</ul>

<p>
These samples demonstrate the program behavior and are supposed to contain every possible type of output message string so that you can prevent your autograder score from being affected by spelling errors and typos.
<p>
<b>These samples are not a complete test of your program!!!</b> Your program will be tested for a large number of other possible inputs and input sequences. You must devise your own complete test set to find the bugs in your code.
<p>
The console outputs are a saved copy of a 
console window after entering the commands by hand. The stdin input file is suitable for redirecting input, and the stdout output can be compared with the redirected output of your program.  Your program should match the stdout output.
<p> 
See the course web page for how to compare files and redirect I/O. In the examples directory on the file server you can find the redirect_io module that you can use to redirect I/O from a C++ program on 
any platform. You can use this to help test your program's output against the supplied samples. The instructions are in the header file.
<p>
</ul>

<H2>Autograder submission and responses</H2>
<p>
No component tests will be performed, so you must submit a complete program to get useful feedback.
However, you should be able to submit a Step 1 version of the 
project and see if it passes the tests that use only the  Project 2 commands. The test feedback
identifies wehich tests involve the new commands.
