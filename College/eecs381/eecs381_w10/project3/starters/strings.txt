* Notes:
1. Only the message strings new to project 3 are shown in this file; the remainder are the same as in project 2.

2. Two or more strings on the same line would be part of the same
line of output, with some variable value output between them.

3. If there is no actual non-whitespace constant text involved in an output statement, the string is not shown here.
