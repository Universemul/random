* Notes:
1. The messages are classified by which module's .cpp file prints them out.
You must follow this classification to be sure your modules behave like mine.

2. Two or more strings on the same line would be part of the same
line of output, with some variable value output between them.

3. If there is no actual non-whitespace constant text involved in an output statement, the string is not shown here.
