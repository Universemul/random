1)  Give two reasons why movie-recommendation is different from Web-page recommendation

-- Many relevant features are hard to extract from movies (acting, fun, etc)
-- People's preferences differ, so a standard training set will not necessarily be helpful.  Making matters worse, most individuals will not add much personalized training data.


2) Explain the difference between a user-based system and an item-based system.

User-based system:  The idea is that a person P will like the movies that are liked by people who are similar to P.  A user-based system finds the K other people who are most-similar to P, and uses their stated preferences to predict P's movie tastes.

Item-based system:  The idea is that a person P will like the movies that are similar to other movies that P has enjoyed in thie past.  An item-based system ranks all movies by their similarity to the movies that P has rated, and weighs them according to how much P liked them.  The resulting rankings are used to recommend movies to P.


3)  Explain what will happen when a person of unusual interests uses a collaborative filtering service.  For example, imagine there is someone who loves Hong Kong action movies and English countryside dramas; this person is the only one in the database with that combination of interests.

a) First, answer this question if the system is a user-centric one that picks the single closest-neighbor.
This person is likely to receive recommendations that suit one of their interests, but not both.  There is no other person in the system who can satisfy all preferences.

b) Next, answer this quesiton if the system uses a weighted combination of the K-nearest neighbors.
This person is why better collaborative filtering services do not simply pick the "most-similar-neighbor" when choosing a neighbor to help with recommendations.  Rather, the recommendations should be a weighted mixture of other people - perhaps some who love action movies, and another population who love dramas.


4)  List three ways that we can measure the similarity of two individuals in a user-centric recommendation system.

-- tf-idf
-- Pearson correlation
-- Jaccardian distance (ignoring scores, just test to see if the person has seen the movie in question).  (This is a hard one!)


5)  What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

For supervised learning, the training set is labelled - it contains the desired answers.  The goal of the learner is to predict the correct answers for novel data that is unlabelled.

In unsupervised learning, not even the training set is labelled.  The learner attempts to automatically group data into the "right" clusters.

6)  Explain the notion of bias in a classification system.

Bias determines the possible classification hypotheses that the system will consider.  It also favors certain hypotheses over others, given identical training data.

7)  Why does one test a trained supervised learner using cross-validation?

Cross validation allows us to evaluate a trained learner using data that has not yet been seen.  By removing a rotating slice of the data, and training multiple times, we can make the best use of a limited amount of data.


8)  If the apriori algorithm were to simply consider itemsets of size i during iteration i, how many iterations would the algorithm take before terminating?

The algorithm will have to take one more iteration than the length of the longest "large itemset" in the data.


9)  Imagine we have the following dataset:

Alice          {Bacon, Cheese, SlimJims}
Bob            {Bacon,  SlimJims, Doritos}
Charles        {Bacon, Doritos, Yogurt}
Dave           {Bacon, SlimJims}
Ed             {Doritos, SlimJims}

What is the support of the following?

a) {Bacon}
b) {Yogurt=>Doritos}
c) {SlimJims=>Bacon}
d) {Bacon, SlimJims=>Yogurt}

------------------------------------------
a) 0.8
b) 0.2
c) 0.6
d) 0


10) Is {Yogurt=>Doritos} a good rule to draw from this data or not?  Why or why not?

Yogurt always implies Doritos, and so the rule may be true.  However, the rule has very little support in the data, and for most data mining applications is not useful.


11) When will Apriori's use of the independence assumption fail to predict itemset size correctly?

The independence assumption assumes that items appear together at random.  If two elements are highly correlated, and one of the items tends to be relatively rare in the data, the independence assumption will incorrectly predict them as appearing together only relatively rarely.o
