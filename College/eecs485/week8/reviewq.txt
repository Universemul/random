Link Analysis and Search Engine Architecture

1)  Consider the following Web graph adjacency matrix:

A-->B
A-->C
B-->C
C-->D
D-->E
E-->B

Compute 3 iterations of the PageRank algorithm for this graph.  Assume that d=0.85


2)  Explain why 0.85 might be a reasonable value for d.  What change in user behavior would account for a rise in d?  What about a decline?


3)  Give three reasons that PageRank might be a misleading guide to page popularity.


4)  Consider these two small web pages:

"The quick brown fox is really cool"

"The cool brown fox is really here."

What is the k-shingle Jaccardian Coefficient for these two documents when k=3?


5)  Imagine that you have a distributed indexing system, and you have 10 machines at your disposal.  A machine may be assigned to parsing or to inverting, but not both.  You have N documents to process, each of which has an identical number of words.  Words are (surprisingly!) equally distributed over the alphabet.

a)  What is your keyspace segmentation strategy?

b)  How many machines should you devote to parsing, and how many to inverting?

c)  OK, that's a bit of a trick question.  You can't completely know the answer just yet.  What other factor do you have to consider?

d)  Now imagine that the distribution of words over the alphabet reflects English - that is, some regions of the alphabet are more heavily represented than others.  What does this change about the system?

6)  Imagine that you have a document-based segmentation scheme for your distributed search query processor.  Unfortunately for you, I just signed a deal with hot real-time messaging startup Dweebler, and I want to add the real-time river of "Dweebs" to the search index.  What problems will this pose for your system?
