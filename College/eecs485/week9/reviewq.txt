You will not be tested on the "Topics in Web Search Research" material.


1) Explain briefly each of the following auction types.  How do they differ?

Ascending bid auction


Descending bid auction


Sealed-bid first-price auction


Sealed-bid second-price auction



2) Explain why a bidder in a second-price auction should always bid the same amount as his valuation of the auction item.


3) Explain why this is not true of a bidder in a first-price auction.


4) "Sniping" is the Ebay practice of increasing one's bid dramatically right before the end of the auction.
Recall that Ebay auctions are sealed-bid second-price auctions (aka, Vickrey auctions).

Why is sniping nonsensical, from the perspective of standard auction/game-theoretic analysis of Vickrey auctions?

Give at least one reason why sniping is nonetheless observed in practice.  For each reason, what part of the analysis of
a Vickrey auction is flawed?



5) What are two practices that made Google ad auctions different from the original Overture ad auctions?
