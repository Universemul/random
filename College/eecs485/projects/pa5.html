<h1>Assignment 5: XML import and export</h1>

<p>
Due Friday, February 26, 2010, at 11:55PM.
</p>

<p>
As described in class, one important use for XML is exchanging data 
between organizations.  
This is the situation where company A
and company B each have a database with similar information, and
they want to share this information.  To do so they get together
and choose a set of tags that describe the information they want
to send to each other.  Let's take our photo album scenario for
example.  You can imagine that users might want album information
in places other than your site: on a desktop application, on a smartphone,
on another album website, etc.  This assignment will give
you practice with packaging database information as XML messages
(files) for outbound transfers and loading information into the
database from incoming XML messages.
</p>

<p>
This assignment consists of two parts (i) exporting data from
your database into XML and (ii) importing data from XML to your
database. You will also use XSL to translate XML into HTML that
can be rendered in a browser.
</p>

<h2>
Part 1:
What is XML?
</h2>



<p>
Here are a set of resources which you may find useful:
</p>

<ul><li>
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp">XML
Tutorial</a> - Read about XML syntax, elements, attributes,
validation, namespaces. No need to read about JavaScript or other programming issues.</li>
<li>

<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">W3C
XML Stylesheet Language Spec</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xsl_languages.asp">A Simple
XSL Tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://us2.php.net/xml">XML Parser Functions in
PHP</a> (Event-driven XML Parser).</li>
</ul><h2>
Part 2:
Export data to XML
</h2>



<p>
On your album editing page, add a new link for each album.  This link
is used to display an XML page containing all the information
about this album.  By &quot;display&quot; we mean that you should print
this XML page to the screen as you would any other page from a
PHP script.  (You can find a <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/eecs485/simple_album.xml">sample XML file here</a>.)  If you have correctly extracted the data and your XML is well-formed,
a modern browser will render it in a tree.
</p>

<p>
Second, add a link that allows users to load a new album from an XML
file, as discussed in Part 4.
</p>

<h2>
Part 3:
Make it pretty
</h2>

<p>
Download this <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/eecs485/pa5_sample.xsl">sample XSLT stylesheet</a>
file.  Create your own XSLT file based on the one provided.
Experiment with different styles; come up with something interesting
and that fits in with the theme of your site.
</p>

<p>
Modify your album editing page such that the user can choose whether
the XML page is displayed with the stylesheet applied or not.  To
apply the style sheet, include a reference to the XSL file in your XML
output:
</p>

<pre>&lt;?xml-stylesheet type=&quot;text/xsl&quot; href=&quot;pa5.xsl&quot;?&gt;

</pre>

<h2>
Part 4:
Import data from XML
</h2>



<p>
When the user clicks on the link to load a new album, he or she
should be presented with a form.  This form has just one text field
used to specify a URL for an XML file containing all the information
about the album to load.  You can assume that the user types a
valid URL that points to a well-formed and valid XML file which
has the same format as the <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~michjc/eecs485/simple_album.xml">sample
XML page</a>.  (Extra credit: add proper error checking to remove that
assumption.)  When he or she clicks submit, this album should be
loaded and stored in the database.  The person loading the album
(obviously) becomes its owner.  As with assignment 2, when you add
a photo to the database you should first check if it already exists
there so that duplicate entries are not created for the same photo.
</p>

<h2>Extra Credit</h2>

Here are extra credit opportunities for this assignment.  Groups of more than 3 people should do at least two on this list.
<ul><li>Add error-checking to XML processing to detect whether file is well-formed and valid.
</li><li>Add error-checking to test whether XML file obeys the format described by the sample file above.
</li><li>Allow the user to select different &quot;themes&quot; for rendering the XML, by substituting several different XSLT files.
</li></ul><p>

</p><h2>Submit your assignment</h2>

<p>
When you have completed the assignment, please send an email to vahed@umich.edu, listing the extra credit items completed.
As always, do not touch files in the pa5 subdirectory after the deadline.
