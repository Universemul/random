<h1>Assignment 6: Information Retrieval</h1>

<p>Due Monday, March 15, 2010, at 11:55 PM</p>

<p>
In this assignment you will learn how to build and maintain an inverted
index, and use it to do simple search queries. You can build this
project on your previous work. However, make sure to make a new copy of
your pa5 code for this assignment.
</p>

<h2>Building Inverted Index</h2>

<p>For this assignment, you will allow users to search for photos with
a text query. You should implement this search feature with an inverted
index. Unlike regular search engines, the corpus will be small enough
that you can build the entire index in memory. However, you should make
sure to compute and write the index to disk just once; then load it
again (once) when your application is initialized. When a user enters a
search query, you will use this loaded in-memory inverted index to rank
photos for the user.
Based on your work for PA5, load the following XML file of 200 photos
with captions. </p><ul>
<li><a href="http://eecs485-2.eecs.umich.edu:12345/pa6/a.xml">http://eecs485-2.eecs.umich.edu:12345/pa6/a.xml</a>
</li></ul>
You will index all of the captions for this set of photos. Treat each
as a separate (small) document, with its own doc-id, etc. A "hit" with
this search index will be a photo, not a traditional web page. All the
files related to your inverted index should be stored in the <strong>pa6/index/</strong> subdirectory. 
<p></p>
<p>
While building the inverted index file, you can use a list of
pre-defined stopwords to remove words that are so common that they do
not add anything to search quality ("and", "the", "etc", etc). You can
find an example of these words at: </p><ul>

<p></p>

<h2>Search</h2>
<p>
Using the inverted index built in the previous part, you should
implement a simple search engine to return the most relevant pictures.
Your engine should include a text box to receive a simple AND,
non-phrase query, and return the ranked list of images. No in-doc
position information is necessary for the inverted index. However,
frequency information IS necessary inside the inverted index, so that
tf-idf can be computed. (The idf value for each term should be placed
in the inverted index at the head of each posting list, near the # of
docs element.)
</p>
<p>It is critical that your search feature use the inverted index for
answering all queries. Because the set of photos is relatively small,
you could probably iterate directly through all of the comment strings
without a huge computational burden. However, the purpose of this
assignment is to learn about the inverted index. If your search feature
simply examines the comment strings directly, you will not receive any
credit.
</p>
<h3>Finding Similar Pictures</h3>
<p>Your photo album should implement a feature for retrieving similar
photos. That is, for each picture in any album, the user should be able
to see a list of photos from the loaded public dataset that are the
most relevant to the picture. Recall that to the search engine, a
"query" and a "document" are basically the same thing; to implement
this feature, you can just take the caption string as a query, and
return the results. </p>



<h2>Search Results</h2>
Make the SERP (Search Engine Results Page) look nice.  A nice list of hits, with photo thumbnails next to each.

<h2>Extra Credit</h2>
Extra credit is given to the groups that can add one or more of the following functionalities to their websites.  <strong>Groups of 4 people are required to do a least 1 of the following in addition to the assignment requirements. </strong>
<ul>
<li> Implementing phrase queries, by modyifying the inverted index so that it maintains position information.</li>
<li> Updating the index file: Upon modifying a caption, the user should be able to update the index file with the new caption.</li>
<li> Integrate the access control from previous PA into your search
component by indexing all the pictures in the website. Search for a
query should only return relevant pictures to which the querying user
has access.
</li></ul>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>We will check your pa6 directory for your new photo album website.
The search capability should be available to all users, as well as
non-users.
</p>
<p>Your website may index other albums, but please ensure that the
provided dataset is indexed and used in your search. Do not touch the
files in pa6 sub-directory after the deadline.
</p>

<p>
When you have completed the assignment, send an email to <a href="mailto:vahed@umich.edu">vahed@umich.edu</a>, listing the extra credit items you have implemented for this assignment.
