<h1>
EECS485 - FINAL PROJECT
</h1>
<h3>Winter, 2010</h3>

The Final Project is intended to allow you to use much of what you've learned in EECS485 to build a website of your own choosing.  It will account for a substantial portion of the time you devote to this class, and is the single largest factor in determining your final grade.  As you can work on almost any project you like, the Final Project should also be the most fun part of the entire course.  As with all projects in EECS485, it will be done as part of your project group.  All members of your group will share in the lessons and the triumph (and the grade) that your Final Project engenders.<p>

Note that you may not use late days for <b>any portion</b> of the final project or its associated sub-deadlines.</p>

Your project will be a Web site that includes a database back-end and some amount of AJAX front-end code.  You are encouraged to be creative in choosing your project.  However, there are a few requirements:

<ul>
<li>Your project must not simply reproduce a site that already exists.  It can be in the ilk of something that exists (a site-builder, a real-estate site), but it must have features that are novel.
<li>It must be non-trivial but doable by the deadline.  Figure on something that is roughly the scope of your completed photo site (the result of PAs 1-7).  So we can make sure that your goals are in the right ballpark, you will hand in a short summary of your goals and give a short presentation to the class several weeks before the deadline.  You are also encouraged to speak with Mike and Vahed outside of class, if you have questions.
<li>It should be generally usable by anyone with a modern web browser.  No obscure plugins or installs, please.
<li>It must have a substantial database back-end.
<li>It should be interesting to a small user base.  Facebook is a great application, but it is useless if only one person signs up.  We must be able to see your project work well even if no one else joins in.  (But if it is improved when other people sign up, that's fine.  Indeed, it's encouraged.)
<li>It should keep the screen pyrotechnics to a minimum.  A single sound effect might be nice.  Streaming video and a soundtrack will probably not be.
<li>It should probably be designed to be useful, rather than entertaining.  Certainly, it should not be a video game inside a web browser window.  However, this line can be fuzzy: the most useful applications often have entertaining elements.  Be thoughtful and somewhat restrained on this point.
<li>It should not include on-screen widgets from external sources (e.g., AdSense from Google includes ads on pages.  There are lots of others.)  If you have a compelling reason to do so, ask before you go through with it.  One exception is the use of Google Maps to render geographic data - this is an extremely useful tool that is applicable to many projects.  But as a rule, the work that appears on-screen should be your own.
</ul>

A few possible ideas:

<ul>
<li>A class-recommendation system.  The system might consume electronic course data from the university, along with user preferences and maybe information from RateMyProfessors.com, or something similar.  The site should then generate tailored results for the user/student.  A system that works across multiple universities, or that considers requirements of the major, would be very useful.
<li>A system for distributed collaborative software engineering.  Google Docs allows nice collaboration between people on Word-style documents.  Try to build the equivalent for programmers.  This should not be a source-code control system.  Think more about times when you have programmed "over someone's shoulder," and try to enable something similar with your site.
<li>The world's best address book.  Build a Website that automatically maintains address information for a user.  Unlike most existing address books, yours should integrate easily with email and existing web services.  Also unlike most address books, yours should avoid the concept of a one-time "import".  Rather, it should constantly be updating and importing data from services associated with your account.  It should also generate output in various formats, both electronic and paper (via a PDF library).
</ul>

A very fruitful way to build a choose a good project is to enable manipulation of a previously-untapped data source.  For example, explore the environmental datasets hosted at data.gov.  You can have visualizations of local toxicity, using Google Maps.  Allow users to integrate with real estate information and especially polluted properties for sale.  Data.gov has a lot of fun and strange datasets, and it is hardly the only source.<p>

Note that you do <b>not</b> need to use PHP for this project.  However, we will be unable to help you with many tools that were not part of the class.  We will not adjust grading expectations if you decide to write your site using Prolog and run into problems.

<h2>Deadlines</h2>
There are several deadlines associated with the final project.

<h3>Project Proposal - March 24, 11:55PM</h3>

Your group will hand in a 2-to-3-page project proposal on March 24, by 11:55PM.  This document should give the reader a good understanding of what your site will do when your project is done.  This document is not expected to be a flawless prediction of your work, but it should reflect some serious thought on your part.<p>

Please be sure to include the following items in your proposal:
<ul>
<li><b>Site overview</b> - a few paragraphs on who will want to use your site, what the site will do, and what users will experience while there.  A mockup screenshot (done with either Photoshop or just pencil-and-paper) is encouraged!<p>
<li><b>Feature list</b> - a list of the features that your site will have.  A "feature" should be pretty specific, e.g., <i>user can upload photos to site for storage</i>.  A feature that is way too broad might be <i>allows user to interact with and meet new people</i>.  Features should fall into three categories: <i>absolute bare-bones</i>, <i>will almost-certainly-get-done</i>, and <i>would-be-great-if-it-gets-done</i>.  Please list about 3 features for each category.<p>
<li><b>External dependencies</b> - a list of the external services, datasets, or software libraries you need to get the project done.  Examples might include Twitter, Google Maps, the Netflix Prize training data, or Hadoop.  You are encouraged to use external resources, with a few caveats.  Don't use on-screen widgets (except for Google Maps - see above).  Don't use an external resource that makes your project trivial.  Don't use dozens and dozens of different external services - you'll go crazy just reading API documentation.<p>
<li><b>Responsibility breakdown</b> - describe the primary responsibilities for each person in your group.  This is not binding, of course, and is not used for grading.  It is intended to make you think deeply about how much work you can realistically take on.<p>
</ul>

Your proposal will not be graded for correctness, but you do need to hand it in.  Failing to hand in a serious proposal will reduce your grade for the final project.  We will read all the proposals and give feedback as necessary.<p>


<h3>Project Pitches - March 31, 10:30AM (slides due March 30, 9:00PM)</h3>
On Wednesday, March 31, you will give a 3-minute "pitch" for your project in class.  This is your chance to tell everyone why your project is going to be great.  Essentially, you should turn your project proposal into a 3-slide PowerPoint presentation.  Each member of your group should speak during this presentation.  There will be time for one or two questions from the audience.  However, with 80 minutes and about 15 groups, time will be at a premium.<p>

To avoid constant swapping of laptops during the presentation day, please mail your slides to the instructor by 9:00PM on Tuesday, March 30.  He will stitch them into a single presentation.  Groups will present in random order, except for the group who is first to submit their slides.  This group can choose an arbitrary place in the ordering ("first", "second-to-last", whatever).<p>

As with the project proposal, there is no such thing as an "incorrect" presentation.  However, it is required.  Failing to make a serious presentation will reduce your grade for the final project.<p>

<h3>Alpha Release - April 9, 9:00AM</h3>
On Friday, April 9, at 9:00AM, you will have an "alpha release" of your project.  By this time, simply email the GSI and instructor with a URL where they can access your in-progress project, along with some brief instructions on what we should look for.  Your site must stay up and running until 2:00PM, so we can have time to examine each project.  The goal is to allow us to evaluate your work so far while there is still time to fix any serious problems.  We will send you feedback as needed.<p>

We certainly do not expect your project to be done by this time, but you should have something real to show us.  We <i>strongly encourage</i> you to build an alpha-release site that is "functional but feature-poor" rather than a site that is "feature-rich and non-functional".<p>

As with all of the above items, the alpha release is required but ungraded.<p>

<h3>Public Release AND CODE DEADLINE - April 19, 10:30AM</h3>
The due date for your final project is 10:30AM on Monday, April 19.  Do not modify your code after that time.  At 10:40AM, we will have in-class project presentations.  Each group will receive 3 minutes to give the class a demo of their work on a projector in class.  The presentation is ungraded, but required.  You can, and are encouraged, to present your work in a way that shows off its best qualities.  This event is intended to be a "fun science fair" rather than a "public defense" of your work.<p>

<h3>Documentation - April 20, 11:55PM</h3>
By 11:55PM on Tuesday, April 20, submit a short (1- or 2-page) text document about your project.  A well-written email is fine.  Describe how to use the site and highlight features that we should be sure to note when evaluating it.<p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

Your work will be graded according to several criteria:
<ul>
<li>The functionality and design of the site itself
<li>The lack of bugs, defects, etc.
<li>Creativity in devising new or interesting features
<li>The extent to which you have successfully implemented the "bare-bones" features listed in your project proposal.  It's fine if your project changes since writing that proposal, as long as you have accomplished a set of bare-bones features of roughly equal difficulty and utility.
</ul>

We will adjust grades and expectations according to group size.  Larger groups should count on accomplishing more.<p>

<h2>Finale</h2>

That's all.  Good luck!<p>
