<h1>
Assignment 7: AJAX
</h1>

<p>Due Tuesday, March 23, at 11:55PM.</p>

<p>
In this assignment you will add client-side AJAX features to your photo site.  As usual, this assignment will build on previous
work.  Make sure to copy your pa6 code into a new directory for this assignment.</p>

<p>
Note that this assignment will require somewhat more self-guided learning than previous assignments.</p>

<h2>
Understanding AJAX</h2>

Database-driven web applications have been at the forefront of
dynamic web content for a decade. The limitations of database-driven
sites - static pages, dramatic reloads for even small changes to onscreen information - should have become 
apparent to you over the course of the semester so far.  AJAX is designed to circumvent many of the
technical limitations imposed by the web page based architecture in which we have been working.
</p>



<p>
Before you dive into writing code, take some time to
familiarize yourself with how AJAX works. <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-ajaxintro1.html">IBM has a 
pretty good introduction</a>, but there are plenty of others on the Web.
</p>

<h2>
Changing your UI.
</h2>

Your first goal will be to improve your site's interface by creating a "gallery slideshow page."  This page will show thumbnails
of all the photos in an album, adjacent to a large "focus" image.  The user should be able to select a thumbnail in order to
change the content of the large focus image.  This is roughly similar to the interface seen in Flickr.

When the slideshow page is loaded, you should pick a default image to appear in the focus area.  When the user clicks on a thumbnail image,
the page should not reload - you should use AJAX to change the content of the focus.

It is acceptable for this portion of the assignment to have the JavaScript be entirely client-side.  That is, you do not need to have
explicit server-side support.  In other words, we have not yet seen the "X" part of AJAX.  The goal here is just to become accustomed 
to using JavaScript.

<h2>
Using Remote Data
</h2>

In this portion of the assignment you will use AJAX to fetch data from a remote Web service and integrate it into your photo application. 
Add a feature to your site where the caption text of the currently-viewed photo is automatically sent as a query to (Amazon, Twitter, Flickr).
Your JavaScript code should asynchronously send this information and get a reply from the service.  
The resulting (tweets, product-links, photos) should then be displayed alongside the photo that the user is currently viewing.  <p>

This service should work without much, if any, integration with your PHP-based server.  
Your code should contact the remote Web service only <i>after</i> the page is completely loaded by the user's browser.<p>

The results should match the look and feel of your webpage, and not feel intrusive.  This feature will be graded
primarily on functionality, but with some attention devoted to how well the presentation meshes with your site.<p>


<h3>Amazon Web Services</h3>
<p>
Using AJAX feauters, you can access Amazon's database via webservice.

The next step will be to prepare to use the Amazon E-Commerce Service, which you will be using in this assignment. 
You will have to go to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> homepage and register for an Access Key to use. 
Next, take some time to familiarize yourself with the operations of the E-Commerce API, whose Web Services Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) can be found <a href="http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/AWSECommerceService.wsdl">here</a>. 

WSDL is an XML format for describing network services as a set of endpoints operating on messages containing either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information. To learn more about WSDLs you can use the following resources:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl</a>
<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/wsdl/wsdl_intro.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/wsdl/wsdl_intro.asp</a>
</ul>

For this assignment, you will be using the Amazon E-Commerce web service to provide links to books which may be relevant to the image someone is viewing. One presents keywords to the ItemSearch API, and receives book titles, authors, and links to Amazon pages in return. 

Here are a number of resources that you may find useful:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/">AWS documentations</a>
<li><a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html">Product Advertising API</a>
<li><a href="http://ajax.phpmagazine.net/2006/02/explore_amazon_web_services_wi.html">An online tutorial on Amazon Search Servises</a>
</ul>


<h3>Alternative Webservices</h3>
Alternatively, you can use any of the Flickr or Twitter APIs to present data from a secondary source. Two useful resources to start with can be found below:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reynoldsftw.com/2009/02/using-jquery-php-ajax-with-the-twitter-api/">accessing Twitter via AJAX</a>
<li><a href="http://kylerush.net/javascript/tutorial-flickr-api-javascript-jquery-ajax-json-build-detailed-photo-wall/">accessing Flickr via AJAX</a>
</ul>

<h2>Extra Credit</h2>
Extra credit is given to groups that can add one or more of the following.  <strong>Groups with 4 people are required to do at least one extra credit in addition to the assignment requirements.</strong>
<ul>
<li> Integrate with multiple services.
<li> Allow "write-access" to either Twitter or Flickr.
<li> <b>Super credit</b>: Allow live chatting among people who are viewing the same album.
</ul>


<h2>Grading</h2>
We will check your pa7 directory for your new photo album website.  
The AJAX capabilities should be present for all users, whether registered/logged-in or not.<p>
Do not touch the files in your pa7 sub-directory after the deadline. <p>

When you have completed the assignment, send an email to <a href="mailto:vahed@umich.edu">Vahed</a>, listing the extra credit items you have implemented.
<p>

Make sure that you have a user 'traveler' with a public album 'Around The World'. Her password is 'rebeccapass'. Make sure that her album "Around The World" has 
all 7 pictures from PA2 with the captions: "Eiffel Tower", "Washington DC", "Great Wall of China", "Stonehenge in summer", "Taj Mahal in India", "Persepolis", and "seoul". 
(Feel free to invent some other exciting captions.) </p>
