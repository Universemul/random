1. Name four different types of security threats to watch out for.

masquerade, data-modification, eavesdropping, denial of service, ....


2. Explain how a replay attack works.

Record communication, and replay (selected portions of) it at a later time.
Replay attacks can sometimes be prevented by using unmodifiable timestamps 
that the server tests.


3. Consider a challenge-response mechanism, in which a server throws a
   challenge to a client (such as asking the client to look at an image and
   read embedded text in the image and reply back with the text) before
   setting up a connection. Why would this mechanism be useful?

This type of mechanism is good for defending against replay attacks, provided
the challenge is different each time, and the response is correspondingly
different.  If the challenge is recycled, such a system is vulnerable to a 
replay attack.


4.How can a web client ensure the authenticity of a web server that it wants
  to establish a connection with? In particular, how can it prevent someone
  masquerading as the server?

The server should authenticate itself using a digital signature.  Standards
like SSL and TLS do this.  A certificate authority will be necessary to
communicate the signer's public key securely.


5. If X wants to send a signed message to Y, and wants to ensure that only Y
   can read the message, how should it encrypt the message?  (Assume that
   both X and Y implement a public-key encryption protocol).

pub_Y(priv_X(m)) for message m


6. Is SSL implemented above or below HTTPS?

SSL is implemented below HTTP (and above above TCP).  The combination of SSL
and HTTP is called HTTPS.


7a. Suppose you have been given p=3,q=11 for a public key encryption scheme.
    Find n, lambda, d, and e.  What is the public key?   The private key?

n = pq = 33
lambda = (p-1)(q-1) = 20
A choice you can make is d=3, e=7.
Public key = 3,33.  Private key = 7,33.

b. Encrypt 29 using the public key determined above.  A decrypt the
   resulting ciphertext using the private key.  Show all computations.

m = 29.  c = m^3 (mod 33) = [m (mod 33)]*[m^2 (mod 33)] (mod 33)
	   = 29 * 16 (mod 33)  =  2

c = 2.   m = c^7 (mod 33) = 2*4*16 (mod 33) = 128 (mod 33) = 29


8.  Suppose you have chosen to build an asymmetric key encryption scheme using
    the prime numbers 5 and 11 as the basis.  What would be your public key?
    What would be the corresponding private key?

lambda = 40.  d=e=9 satisfies mathematically, but is not satisfactory, since we
really want the private and public keys to be different.
d=11=121 has the same problem.
d=17, e=33 does the job.


9.  Bob wants to send a signed and dated message m to Alice in a way that no
    eavesdropper can learn the content of m.  How does he do so?

Send pub_Alice (m, priv_Bob(h(m), date))
