1. Name four different types of security threats to watch out for.

2. Explain how a replay attack works.

3. Consider a challenge-response mechanism, in which a server throws a
   challenge to a client (such as asking the client to look at an image and
   read embedded text in the image and reply back with the text) before
   setting up a connection. Why would this mechanism be useful?

4.How can a web client ensure the authenticity of a web server that it wants
  to establish a connection with? In particular, how can it prevent someone
  masquerading as the server?

5. If X wants to send a signed message to Y, and wants to ensure that only Y
   can read the message, how should it encrypt the message?  (Assume that
   both X and Y implement a public-key encryption protocol).

6. Is SSL implemented above or below HTTPS?

7a. Suppose you have been given p=3,q=11 for a public key encryption scheme.
    Find n, lambda, d, and e.  What is the public key?   The private key?

7b. Encrypt 29 using the public key determined above.  A decrypt the
    resulting ciphertext using the private key.  Show all computations.

8.  Suppose you have chosen to build an asymmetric key encryption scheme using
    the prime numbers 5 and 11 as the basis.  What would be your public key?
    What would be the corresponding private key?

9.  Bob wants to send a signed and dated message m to Alice in a way that no
    eavesdropper can learn the content of m.  How does he do so?
