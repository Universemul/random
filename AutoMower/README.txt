There are two options to run the project:

Option 1: Run from Visual Studio

Open the solution with Visual Studio and run the AutoMower project. The inputFile.txt will be used in the execution of the program.


Option 2: Run the execution

From the command line run:
AutoMower.exe [PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE]

If no input file is provided it reads from inputFile.txt in the current directory.
